Welcome to a new site about Underground Manchester. You’ve managed to find this site before I’ve properly launched it, and as such you’ll find it a bit lacking.

This is the culmination of a fascination about Manchester’s underground features that has led me to compile the features I read about and find mentioned around the internet into an interactive map. This was mostly for my own personal curiosity, and to allow me to get a feel for the layout of things I was reading about. As I added more and more I found it fascinating how rich the history of the city is and was well and truly hooked. I added photos that I found for my own record, and as the map wasn’t public I didn’t request permission to reproduce them here.

I have a few tasks to complete, mainly around gathering permission for image use (or removing images) and ensuring I haven’t infringed anyone’s intellectual property.

I can not stress enough that I have no interest in upsetting writers or photographers, and as such I would encourage you to [get in touch](mailto:underground.manchester@gmail.com) if you spot anything you would like to be removed and I will cooperate quickly.
